# Personal Finance Tracker
# Project Description

Personal Finance Tracker is a web-based application that helps users manage their daily finances by tracking income, expenses, current balance, and personal debts (Udhar). The application runs completely in the browser and stores data using LocalStorage.

# Problem Statement

Managing daily financial transactions manually is difficult and error-prone. There is a need for a simple tool that allows users to record income, expenses, and debts in one place without relying on external software or internet connectivity.

# Features Implemented

Add income and expense transactions

Automatic calculation of total income, total expenses, and balance

Filter transactions (All / Income / Expense)

Category-wise spending display

Udhar (debt) management system

LocalStorage for data persistence

# DOM Concepts Used

document.getElementById()

addEventListener()

Dynamic element creation using createElement()

Event handling (onclick, onsubmit)

Updating DOM using innerHTML

Class manipulation using classList

# Steps to Run the Project

# Known Limitations

Data is stored only in the browser (no cloud backup)

No authentication or multi-user support

No export option (CSV/Excel)
